### Project Overview
Although not stated explicitly, the goal of this first project was to learn enough R markdown to present project results in a professional manner while also taking the first steps to developing an R-based project.  This included downloading and accessing data files in various formats and then displaying a few descriptive statistics.
  
Specifically, we were charged with:

  * creating a markdown file and bullet point the steps
  * downloading a file from internet 
  * using 3 different R functions (e.g., plot, cor, pairs, etc.)
  * briefly summarizing the observations
  * finding an R data set
  * doing three different visuals on the set (barplot, boxplot, etc.)
  * finding a graph, image or grapicfile to insert into the markdown
  * inserting 3 references (links)
  * additionally, I set up an "R publish" account and uploaded this markdown file
    
The work product is this file itself.

### Input, Output Commands
1. Retrieving Files from the Internet

  There are a variety of commands to allow downloading of files from the internet.  If the data file is accessible directly, one can use the following sequence:
  
  fileURL <- 

```{r }
system('curl -o data.csv https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/ag7x-nwtv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD')
system('mv data.csv housing_data.csv')
```

2. Reading files
+ CSV files,  read.csv
+ XML files
+ Postgres data, read.table,
  source, dump
  dget, dput
  readLines, Writelines
  save
  serialize

### Miscellaneous Commands
?help(method)

demo(data.table)
  
getwd()  -get working directory

setwd()  -set working directory

### Summarize an R dataset

```{r airquality}
dim(airquality)

head(airquality, 3)

summary(airquality)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }
pairs(airquality)
```

```{r }
ozone <- airquality$Ozone
temp <- airquality$Temp 
plot(temp, ozone)
```
