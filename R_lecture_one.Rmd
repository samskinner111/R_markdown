## Project Overview
Although not stated explicitly, the goal of this first project was to learn enough R markdown to present project results in a professional manner while also taking the first steps to developing an R project.  This included downloading and accessing data files in various formats and then displaying a few descriptive statics.
  
Specifically, we were charged with:

  * creating a markdown file and bullet point the steps
  * downloading a file from internet 
  * using 3 different R functions (e.g., plot, cor, pairs, etc.)
  * briefly summarizing the observations
  * finding an R data set
  * doing three different visuals on the set (barplot, boxplot, etc.)
  * finding a graph, image or grapicfile to insert into the markdown
  * inserting 3 references (links)
  * additionally, I set up an "R publish" account and uploaded this markdown file
    
The work product is this file itself.

## R Markdown


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
